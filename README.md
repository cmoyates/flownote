# FlowNote

A note-taking AI helper designed to capture, refine, and organize your thoughts seamlessly. FlowNote records your voice, transcribes it, and uses an LLM to process the content into coherent notes, which are then saved directly to your Notion workspace.

This app is being developed with React Native and TypeScript using the Expo framework, with an initial focus on deployment to Android via APK so I can just upload it to my phone.
